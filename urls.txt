# Comments start with # and blank lines are ignored.
# Optional per-item flags using key=value segments after the URL (order doesn't matter):
# - threshold=PRICE
# - warehouse=on|off|only   (only = alert on Warehouse offers exclusively)
# - alerts=stock|price|none   (default: both)
# - label="Short Name"        (optional display name used in console/webhooks)
# - notify=once               (send one alert per unique state; suppress duplicates until it changes)
